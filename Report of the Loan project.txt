Here is a detailed, page-by-page report with insights and actionable recommendations—each point elaborated based on your PDF data:

Page 1: Home Loan & Deposit Analysis Dashboard

Client Profile and Loan Volume:
The dashboard presents a total of ~2,910 clients across various banking relationships, with both male and female segments included. Total loans given out amount to 13.15 trillion, indicating extensive lending across the client base. Deposits across all account types reach 11.30 trillion, which shows significant engagement but also highlights gaps where deposit totals trail loan issuance. The dataset includes savings accounts, checking accounts, and business lending, all contributing differently to loan and deposit volumes. Banks must carefully analyze the reasons deposit volumes lag behind loan volumes to ensure healthy risk management.

Loan Distribution by Relationship and Income Band:
Loans have been distributed to clients associated with commercial, institutional, private, and retail banks, showing diversity in client-bank relationships. Within these relationships, the report splits loan volumes into income bands: low, medium, and high. Notably, high-income bands receive the largest portion (942.49M), but substantial lending occurs in low (448.19M) and medium (383.47M) bands, which could be riskier. This distribution points towards possible overexposure in lower income segments if repayment ability doesn’t match loan amounts. A targeted audit of loans in these riskier bands could curb future defaults.

Loan Distribution by Gender, Nationality & Occupation:
Both female and male clients are receiving loans across all institution types, showing equitable lending policies in gender terms. The nationality breakdown (European, Asian, American, Australian, African) reveals that risk is present in all groups, with no nationality-specific concentration. The occupation breakdown is vital—roles like Account Coordinator, Executive, and Representatives are disproportionately represented among larger loans. These client segments should be closely monitored for payment difficulties and financial counseling initiatives.

Problem of Defaults Not Isolated:
Loan defaults (delayed or skipped payments) are occurring across all banking institutions and relationship categories, rather than being contained to one area. This means the problem is system-wide, affected by both private and institutional banks, as well as all client relationship types. Defaults are most evident among clients who maintain low deposits and take high-value loans, representing an imbalance between the client's savings habit and their borrowing behavior. This underscores the need for risk assessment protocols that look beyond type of banking relationship and focus on financial behaviors and metrics.

Recommendation—Deposit/Loan Ratio Control & Collateral Requirement:
To reduce defaults, banks should implement strict checks on deposit/loan ratios before loan approval. Clients borrowing disproportionately higher amounts than their deposits should be asked for additional collateral or co-signers. Loan approvals in risky income or occupation bands must be linked to strong financial histories and property ownership evidence. Automated alert systems can be set up using Power BI analytics to flag high-risk clients for financial counseling or enhanced due diligence.

Page 2: Deposit Segmentation and Additional Analysis

Segmented Deposit Overview:
This section breaks down deposits by bank relationship (commercial, institutional, private, retail), gender, occupation, and nationality. Total deposits vary markedly by relationship—some banks hold much higher client reserves than others, and deposit distribution gives an early indication of which client segments have greater financial security. Comparing these deposit figures to corresponding loan volumes, banks can quickly spot candidate segments for default risk and intervention.

Income Band and Deposit Patterns:
The analysis of deposits by income day and income band (low, medium, high) provides insights into client savings behavior. Deposit amounts are clearly higher in high-income bands, but significant numbers of clients in low and medium income groups maintain only minimal reserves. Clients with low deposits are at a higher risk of default when granted large loans, as they lack the backup to weather financial stress. Banks should require minimum deposit levels for higher-value loans, particularly in low and medium income bands.

Deposit by Nationality and Occupation:
The nationality and occupation analytics reveal risks and strengths in client pools. Some nationality groups (e.g., African, Asian) may show persistently lower deposit levels, making them more prone to payment challenges when loans are approved. By occupation, Account Coordinators and various classes of Account Representatives are significant deposit holders, but also loan recipients—thus monitoring repayment histories and financial engagement in these roles is essential for risk control.

Default Risk by Relationship Type:
Analysis shows defaults are not limited to a particular type of bank or relationship. Instead, commercial, institutional, private, and retail relationships all show evidence of loan defaults, but with concentration in client segments with the lowest deposits and highest relative loan amounts. This pattern necessitates risk evaluation models that consider individual financial status and engagement rather than just institutional category.

Recommendation—Enhanced Loan Approval Rules & Behavioral Tracking:
Banks should refine loan approval rules to require stronger deposit histories, collateral, and even third-party guarantees for clients without properties or in low-deposit segments. Behavioral tracking through Power BI dashboards should provide early warnings for increasing default risk—for example, when a client’s deposit levels fall or when new large loans are granted. Financial literacy programs, repayment reminders, and personalized engagement campaigns can help clients avoid future defaults and banks maintain healthy portfolios.

Page 1: Home Loan Analysis & Deposit Analysis Dashboard

Client Segmentation and Loan Volumes

The dashboard shows a diverse client pool of approximately 2,910 individuals, categorized by gender, nationality, occupation, and banking relationships.

Loans distributed amount to an impressive 13.15 trillion, reflecting aggressive lending across all relationship types—commercial, institutional, private, and retail.

The high volume of loans compared to total deposits (11.30 trillion) signals a potential risk, with certain client groups possibly borrowing above safe limits.

Savings accounts, business lending, and checking accounts all contribute to loan and deposit flows, but imbalances indicate the need for stricter controls.

Vigilance is needed to prevent system-wide risk from aggressive lending, prompting banks to regularly reconcile loan issuance with deposit growth.

Loan Patterns by Income Band and Relationship Type

The distribution of loans by income bands reveals most credit goes to high-income clients (942.49M), but a significant number of loans are also extended to medium (383.47M) and low-income (448.19M) groups.

Bank relationships (private, retail, commercial, institutional) do not restrict risk; defaults occur in all, especially where deposits are much lower than loans.

Most concerning is the presence of defaults in low and medium income bands, indicating lending practices may not fully factor in income’s stability or repayment potential.

Auditing these segments for repayment patterns and loan-to-income ratios can reveal structural weaknesses in loan approval processes.

Systematic corrections should link loan limits to income and deposit history rather than relying solely on relationship category.

Analysis by Gender, Occupation, and Nationality

Male and female clients are both well-represented among loan recipients, showing that risk-policing must be equally stringent for all genders.

Occupations such as Account Coordinator, Account Executive, and Account Representative receive large sums, but also show higher unpaid balances.

Nationality plays a role, with European, Asian, American, Australian, and African clients all present—risk clusters must be identified via further nationality and occupation cross-analysis.

These demographic insights enable banks to pinpoint risky clusters and launch targeted financial counseling or repayment programs.

Bank policies should incorporate ongoing demographic analysis to keep up with evolving risk patterns.

Problem of Systemic Defaults

Loan defaults are not restricted to one bank or customer category, but rather appear across all client relationships and institutional segments.

The highest risk is found where individuals have low deposit holdings but large loans, regardless of which bank serves them.

This systemic default risk must be handled through unified industry standards for risk and lending assessment, not through category-specific controls.

Banks need shareable intelligence on loan performance and default trends to better react to new risks across the system.

Policy makers and regulators can use these findings to push for stricter regional or national lending standards.

Recommendations for Deposit/Loan Ratios and Collateral Requirements

Banks should make it mandatory for clients to maintain healthy deposit-to-loan ratios before loan approval.

For clients lacking property, collateral, or a strong deposit history, stricter checks and co-signer requirements should be in place prior to sanctioning high-value loans.

Deploying automated Power BI monitoring for high loan, low deposit, and occupation-based risk segments will help reduce defaults.

Loan officers should receive regular training on risk analytics and early warning signals, helping them notice dangerous trends before loans are approved.

Ongoing engagement and personalized repayment plans for at-risk clients will lead to better payment behavior and portfolio stability.

Page 2: Deposit Segmentation and Relationship Risk

Deposit Overview by Banking Relationship

Bank deposits are broken down by commercial, institutional, private, and retail relationships, giving a snapshot of financial stability among client pools.

Some relationships show better deposit ratios, but the overall pattern highlights that lower deposits and higher loans mean higher risk across all banking types.

The report’s charts enable direct detection of client groups whose savings habits do not match their credit tendencies.

Proactive outreach to low deposit segments can prevent future loan defaults by guiding clients towards better savings practices.

Policy revisions to require minimum deposits for loan approval should be implemented across all banking relationships.

Income Band and Deposit Engagement

Deposit volumes segmented by income bands highlight that high-income clients reliably maintain larger savings, lowering their risk of default on large loans.

In contrast, low and medium income groups have low deposits, exposing banks to repayment risk when these clients are given high-value loans.

Minimum deposit requirements and stepwise loan approval upgrades can ensure clients do not borrow beyond their financial capacity.

This clear linkage between deposits and risk must inform every bank’s lending policy and credit rating framework.

Data-driven engagement: Clients with dipping deposit levels receive immediate guidance or alerts, reducing risk of quick default.

Deposit Patterns by Nationality & Occupation

The report divides deposits and loans by nationality and occupation, illuminating hidden risks in demographic subgroups.

Certain nationalities show persistent low deposits and frequent loan approvals, which needs strategy involvement: education, local outreach, or specialized products.

Large deposit holders in specific occupations must be incentivized for loyalty and safe investment rather than high-risk borrowing.

Bank analysts should regularly produce dashboards on at-risk occupations and nationalities for more precise loan monitoring and follow-up.

Cross-tab analysis in Power BI can highlight the most vulnerable occupation-nationality pairs.

Defaults Across Relationship Types—Detailed Risk Profile

Whether commercial, institutional, private, or retail, each relationship type houses both high-deposit, low-risk clients and low-deposit, high-risk ones.

Embedded risks are especially pronounced in commercial and retail banks serving large volumes or faster turnover customer bases.

System-wide rules should address loan approval for all types, eliminating “category blind spots” to risk where policies may be outdated.

Real-time risk profiling and loan repayment monitoring should be routine and tightly integrated in Power BI dashboards.

Periodic review cycles of every client segment must be enforced so that risk signals do not go unnoticed.

Advanced Recommendations—Behavioral Analytics and Remediation

Use Power BI’s behavioral analytics to spot clients at risk; default clusters by deposit history, occupation, and transaction pattern must drive outreach.

Financial literacy webinars, loan repayment reminders via SMS and email, and personalized banking advisors should be deployed for vulnerable segments.

Create dashboard alerts for when deposit levels decline or new large loans are approved in weak financial bands.

Engage in credit counseling partnerships and government support for at-risk communities identified in your dashboard.

Continuous improvement: Bank management reviews default data monthly to steer new policy direction and loan approval criteria.
